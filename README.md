# UDP
UDP Client and Server

This code creates a UDP client and a UDP server. The client receives input from the user and sends that input to the server. 
The server converts the input it receives to uppercase letters and sends it back to the client. 
This process is accomplished by exchanging a series of data packets between the client and the server.
